# Starter-Kit

## Description
The TOP Starter Kit is an open-source, reconfigurable platform for Organ on Chip (OoC) research. It implements a Fluidic Circuit Board (FCB) architecture, meaning that Microfluidic Building Blocks (MFBBs) are the functional units and fluids are routed between MFBBs via a single manifold, the FCB.

The specific FCB used in the Stater Kit is designed to allow arbitrary connections between microfluidic modules. Interconnections can be easily changed to whatever the user desires by simply exchanging a single MFBB called the Routing Block. 

Microfluidic building block port layouts and footprints follow our [TOP Design Rules (TDRs)](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/2558bd4c-d7ad-4e17-bc54-8c335b4c1c01) which are compliant with [ISO 22916:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/74157.html) (See also: [a short introduction to ISO:22916:2022](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/871d6c3a-cf1a-44f9-865a-6da842bd2f27/2)).

Taking all of it's features together, the TOP Starter Kit allows a powerful simplification of the broader OoC design space: A chip designer needs only to adhere to the TDRs to ensure that their device can be immediately used in a wide range of different fit-to-purpose fluidic circuits without ever needing to design a custom FCB.
