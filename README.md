# Starter-Kit

Design files for the TOP Starter-Kit Fluidic Circuit Board.

All Microfluidic Building Block (MFBB) port layouts and footprints comply with [ISO 22916:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/74157.html).  A short introduction on application of ISO 11916:2022 can be found [here](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/871d6c3a-cf1a-44f9-865a-6da842bd2f27/2).

MFBB port layouts and footprints for Sensors, Reservoirs and Organ on Chip (OoC) devices follow the [Top Design Rules (TDRs)](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/2558bd4c-d7ad-4e17-bc54-8c335b4c1c01) as well.
